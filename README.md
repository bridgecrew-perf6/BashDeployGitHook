# BashDeployGitHook
Git hook that can deploy code to pre-production/production



This is a simple script that must be used as a hook, in a git repository, to deploy code on production/preproduction.
As it's pure-bash, you don't have to work-around standards to pretend you know what you're doing, or install shady stuff.



Have fun. <3

## How to use?

Simply place it in the `./hooks/` directory on your bare repo (or link it), chmod it, chown it, and it's cooked. Don't forget to configure targets before-hand.
